Many of us already know and agree on how great the book "<em>Effective Java</em> by <em>Joshua Bloch"</em> is and it's a must read for every Java Developer out there whether you have just started or working for a while.While reading the book and researching on some of the Items listed in the book, I came across this Interview with <em>Joshua Bloch</em> Link at <em>Oracle</em> ,

in which he speaks about some of the great things in the book and shares his knowledge on some great topics in the language.This should be a good read for someone interested to explore more while reading this book or afterwards -
