Answer by Vishnu Haridas:
<blockquote>This one I discovered recently: If you get an unusable headphones, don't throw it away. You can cut &amp; remove the wire, and use the TRS jack as the FM antenna for your smartphone.</blockquote>
All you need is to plug-in this TRS jack into your phone's headphones plug, and open the FM radio app, then start listening through your loudspeaker.

<i>How it works: </i>The headphones wire works as the FM antenna for mobile phones. Usually FM transmission will have a very strong signal, which needs a small piece of wire to receive the signal.
