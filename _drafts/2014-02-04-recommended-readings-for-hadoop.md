I am writing this series to mention some of the recommended reading to understand Hadoop, its architecture, minute details of cluster setup etc.

**[Understanding Hadoop Cluster Setup and Network](http://bradhedlund.com/2011/09/10/understanding-hadoop-clusters-and-the-network/)** - Brad Hedlund, with his expertise in Networks, provides minute details of cluster setup, data exchange mechanisms of a typical Hadoop Cluster Setup.

**MongoDB and Hadoop** - Webinar by Mike O'Brien, Software Engineer, MongoDB on how MongoDB and Hadoop can be used together, using core MapReduce and Pig and Hive as well.
